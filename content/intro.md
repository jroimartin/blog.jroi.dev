Hello, world!

My name is Roi Martin. I am a computer programmer and a security
enthusiast that has been lucky enough to make a living out of
combining both passions.

I am one of those people that think that programs and algorithms can
be beautiful and elegant.

> Elegance is articulating the value of absence.

This definition of elegance comes from a [talk] by [Devine Lu Linvega]
during the [Strange Loop Conference] in 2023, but it explains pretty
well what it means to me.

I have created this blog as a means to share ideas, projects, links
and, in general, anything I consider interesting. I do not expect to
publish content regularly, but I feel the need for a place where I can
share content at length without the (not always technical) constraints
imposed by many platforms.

You can also find me in [GitHub], where I publish most of my projects,
and [Mastodon].
